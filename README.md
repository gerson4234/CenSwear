# CenSwear
A small Python project meant to both swear and censor your life.

This is a Python project of mine that essentially works as a soundboard, but for swearing and censoring. It's built to be used on a Raspberry Pi so that you can use it on the go. Before using it, I'd suggest changing the GPIO pin values to what ever you're using, I defaulted to using (insert pins used here). Sounds will also need to be added, as for privacy reasons I will not upload the recordings used here.
